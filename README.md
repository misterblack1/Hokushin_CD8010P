# Hokushin CD 8010P 8" Hard Drive 
THese are the ROMs dumped from the Hokushin CD 8010P 8" hard drive. I don't currently have any other information about this drive, but the CPU on both the hard drive PCB and the attached interface PCB is an Intel 8085, so these ROMs will be for that. 

The main hard drive PCB has 256 bytes of SRAM and the adapter/interface board has 2x2114 SRAM, so 2K of RAM.

It turns out this drive was made for Priam:

The drive is a "Priam DiskOS1070" and the interface is the "Priam Smart Interface."
